- 👋 Hi, I’m @crystalleighsellers1982
- 👀 I’m interested in the reteaching of accountability and ethics, something this word only knows as another mendel affect. But freedom comes with many perks. And today im going to
- demonstrate just a few examples of how we the people are gonna countersuit anyone who goes against our ethics..see how is it we live in a world were we cant express our joy during the holidays,or
-or even discipline the bad behaivior our children are demonstrating daily. Well lets start with basic..we allow it..number one, God gave us the abilty to grow and by allowing platforms and ai and whatever
other bullshit weve been feed to misguide us(bad direction) well, that pretty much makes it our own unaware asses fault. with that being said i am taking accountability for my own acceptance of the norm.
 with that im demanding you stay out of my personal life, a place where you have no business and i can assure you i will stay out of your business affairs. Because honestly im quite sick
of misleading email overload. How is it one can e approved of so many qoverment programs daily yet have never even applied. or how about all the money i have won yet did nothing to receive ,
 how about all the interview i have this week for jobs i never applied to but ,the Topper of the Day. would be the daily bible versees that come along with all the fake shit that over whelmes me so
 much i get frustrated and cant even properly retain work or any kind of assistance due to the stress of all the fake shit im being drowed with. which in
return has robbed me of the abbilty to better myself for way to long now. So hear me loud and clear Credit card arena and associates. you no longer have any jurisdiction in my world im reclaiming
 my indepence by starting with claiming my accountability for allowing this circus for way to long. Now with holding myself accountable i can see where i was wrong and grow from there .
 It is not a matrix or a cycle im stuck its not even a way of life its more like a pool of bullshit im being sumerged with. so im taking back ever aggremnt you may have on record the you slyfully gained. i
 retracting all acceptance of any misguided bad direction you have tryed to trap me in Im planning on posting this on you platform ,my platform..materfact all over this flatformed earth.from one side ofthe
farliment to the other. since we americans have become so lazy we sell our own selves out, just to not have to show effort. I hope this finds you well and shows that nolonger can you contol cameras i own, or mic i speak thru
,or see my contacts ,read my message or hijack my bluetooth speaker or deceite me in any way.i hope that this is transparent enough for your own well being because im pretty sure(Red Bull)
   never intended to besued for not giving wings but they were and lost. Im Not a sue happy american but i will be heard ..and i will stand firm to my beleif in privacy ive been living inthe truman show long enough
just know in my down time my off camera moments are ful of learning and researching. So if you live in a glass house you better be able to but on a show worth gaining the right attention. Personally i am over skilled for the job
i can put on one hell of a show. much regards you future equalifed developer
